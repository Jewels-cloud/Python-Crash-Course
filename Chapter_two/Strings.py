# Weare altering strings today

# len()checks the numbers of chracters in a string:
Number_of_chr = "Lets check"
len(Number_of_chr)

# s.upper() and s.lower() puts them in higher or lower case
s = 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.'
print(s)
s.upper()
print(s)

# The.count() method adds up the number of times a character or sequence of characters appears in a string.
s = "That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is"
s.count("t")
